MongoDB demo of adding and showing host:
----------------------------------------
This demo shows the basic usage of mongoDB as well as posting and rendering data with frontend.
Just give you guys a basic idea of how to setup mongodb

1. Make sure you had done the instruction above to setup database and server
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/host
    enter data for testing, if insertion to database succeeded, console would show "Submission completed".
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/host/show
    this will show all hosts that are stored in the database.



FYI: Location of relative files
Schema:
    models/host.js
Routing and restful API handling:
    controllers/routeHost.js
    view/newhost.html
    server.js (this is where the db is connected to, remember to add the route module to here using app.use() to connect it to the frontend)
